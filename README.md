# Processing-toys
A small library of sketches that I made for friends and other people to use.

You're going to need:
  - A computer
  - Processing installed on that computer

Steps you need to take:
  - Install Processing if you haven't already
  - Download this library as a .zip
  - Open Processing and open the .pde file
  - Press the Play button in Processing to start the application
  - ✨ Have fun! ✨
